# Damage-Game
it was a lab assignment for OOP
Project Name: Gaming Dynamics Lab Assignment

Description:
Welcome to our Gaming Dynamics Lab Assignment repository! In this project, we explore the fascinating world of gaming dynamics through the lens of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Our goal is to develop a conceptual framework for a game featuring unique characters, each with distinct powers and abilities.

Technical Details:
In our implementation, we have created separate classes for each character, leveraging the concept of inheritance and polymorphism. Through virtual functions, we have customized the damage mechanisms for each character while maintaining a consistent framework for gameplay.

Repository Contents:

Source code files for each character class (DEMON.cpp, HUMAN.cpp, ELF.cpp, CYBERDEMON.cpp, BALROG.cpp)
Main program demonstrating the use of virtual functions to implement damage mechanisms (main.cpp)
Documentation and README files providing an overview of the project structure and code implementation details
Contributing:
We welcome contributions from the open-source community to further refine and expand upon our conceptual framework. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to the world of programming, your insights are valuable to us.

I have used my own defined String class to use this code you have to add C++ built in String and have to change code a little bit.
